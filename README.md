# DONATION TRACKER APP
Blockchain-based donation management platform


## The Main Concept of the project
Providing transparent and traceable public donations is vital for the health of any non-profit organization (NGO). Tacking who is responsible for the donation campaigns and where the donated money goes and what a good impact is it make are significant concerns for charitable donors worldwide. NGOs themselves want to track their operations to provide transparent information about their missions and how they are working towards achieving the goals of these missions. By doing that, NGOs could positively touch by honestly positioning themselves so that donors can relate to their cause. By utilizing blockchain technology, specifically Ethereum, these concerns and needs that charitable donors and NGOs have will be solved by building a public donation platform where NGOs and generous donors can connect. Then through the blockchain, donors can trace NGOs' operations regarding their donations.

## What we will solve?
We want to bridge the gap between charitable donors and NGOs globally by providing a unified platform where donors and NGOs can interact. This platform will make it easy for donors worldwide to select charitable campaigns of each NGO for donation instead of going to each NGO website and then looking for donation campaigns. Hence, NGOs could increase the transparency of their operations, plus the donors could have information about their donation and the impact it has made on the world. In total, this platform would provide granular details about how charitable contributions operated and the impact it has made for humanity.
